    Hello world!
## Test repository
Usually, git messages sound like instructions for what you’ve done, like you would have in a to-do list. In fact, I often have a detailed to-do list for my coding work, and when I’ve done something from the list, in addition to checking it off I also copy and paste it as my commit message!
“Add basic unit tests to the project”
“Spellcheck project description file”
“Fix error in flag type”
Commit messages should be brief and descriptive.

## To do list

- Create a folder called "resources"
- Add in three text files with notes
- Save everything, add it, commit it sensibly
- **Push**

- git status
